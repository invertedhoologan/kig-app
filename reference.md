Build a web-based platform (mobile-first and desktop-ready) that enables community groups in Knysna to manage, report, and resolve local infrastructure challenges such as water outages, sewer issues, power failures, security threats, and waste management.

It will serve both the public and private work groups within Knysna and must support modular growth to include other towns later.
